  name: Auction based cost averaging
  description: >
    Swap some token for another token regularly over time, using a preset budget.

    This is called "cost averaging" because spreading out a single large swap
    into many smaller swaps over time reduces the impact of temporary market
    movements.

    The strategy works by repeatedly auctioning off tokens with an exponential
    decay in the price, that resets each trade.

            If this hourly auction starts at 30 WETH per WBTC, and the baseline is 10 WETH per WBTC,

            This is the inverse (i.e. `1 / x`) of the ETH/BTC ratio.

            For example, 20 WETH per WBTC would mean never selling WBTC when the

            Note that this moving baseline is ignored if it goes below the baseline.
            I.e. the absolute minimum baseline overrides this if necessary.

            The strategy will pretend that a trade was made at this price before
            the first auction, so that everything else can be calculated from there.

            This is WETH per WBTC, so if the ETH/BTC ratio is 0.05 then this should be 20.

            You can set this much higher than the market rates to start the strategy
            off easily, for example you could set it at 50 if the market was around 20-25.

            There is no need for this to be exact, it just has to be ballpark and
            definitely higher than the market. Any number within 1-10x the real
            price should be fine.

            This should be greater than the baseline.
